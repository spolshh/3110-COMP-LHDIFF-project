Reiss scoring system:

"change" means we're matching a line to the wrong line:

<LOCATION ID='L_03' ORIG='5' NEW='5'>
	  <METHOD ID='U_BEST_DIFF' LINE='3' />

"spurious" means we're matching a line that should have been deleted:

<LOCATION ID='L_04' ORIG='7' NEW='-1'>
	  <METHOD ID='U_BEST_DIFF' LINE='3' />

"elim" means we think a line was deleted when in fact it's still there.

<LOCATION ID='L_03' ORIG='5' NEW='5'>
	  <METHOD ID='W_EXACT_LINE#1' LINE='-1' />
